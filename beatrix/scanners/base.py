        retry, WAF evasion, and session expiry detection.

        WAF evasion features (all automatic, zero scanner-level changes):
        - Rotates User-Agent on every request
        - Adds random timing jitter when WAF profile is set
        - Detects WAF block pages and retries with HTTP-level bypasses
        - Adaptive throttling: slows down when consecutive blocks detected
        - Exponential backoff on 429 (up to 3 retries)

        Circuit breaker: tracks consecutive transport errors (DNS failure,
        connection refused, timeout) per host.  After _CB_THRESHOLD
        consecutive failures on the same host, raises
        ``CircuitBreakerOpen`` immediately — prevents scanners from
        spending minutes retrying a dead host across their payload loop.
        A successful response resets the counter for that host.

        When auth is configured and the server returns 401/403, tracks
        consecutive failures. After hitting the threshold, logs a warning
        that the session may have expired. This allows the kill chain to
        detect and handle re-authentication between phases.
